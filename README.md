# Power BI Projects Repository

## Description:

This Github repository contains some of my Power BI projects that I have worked on. Power BI is a business intelligence tool used for data analysis and visualization, and it allows me to create interactive dashboards and reports that can provide insights into various business metrics.

The projects in this repository demonstrate my proficiency in using Power BI to analyze and visualize data from different sources, including CSV, Excel, and SQL databases. The projects showcase different types of visualizations, such as tables, charts, maps, and custom visuals, and demonstrate my ability to create interactive reports with slicers, filters, and drill-down capabilities.

All the projects in this repository were created using Power BI Desktop, and the data used for the projects is included in the repository. The projects can be downloaded and opened in Power BI Desktop, and the data can be refreshed or replaced with new data sources to analyze different datasets.

## Goals: 

* Seeks to identify associations or relationships between products that are frequently purchased together by customers.
* Set Lift 

## Future Work:

* Currently as the sample size is small a cross join is used in Power Query to generate the possible combination of basekts. This is however, computationally epensive whent there are many products.
 > Apirori algorithm can be implemented in python.
